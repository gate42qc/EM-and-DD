    "In an early paper [Physical Review A 51, 992 (1995)](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.51.992) W. G. Unruh found that the coupling to the environment sets an ultimate time and size limit for any quantum computation. This initially curbed the hopes that the full advantage of quantum computing could be harnessed, since it set limits on the scalability of any algorithm. This problem was, at least in theory, remedied with the advent of quantum error correction, [P. W. Shor, Physical review A 52, R2493 (1995)](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493). It was proven that if both the decoherence and the imprecision of gates could be reduced below a finite threshold value, then quantum computation could be performed indefinitely [A. Y. Kitaev, Russian Mathematical Surveys 52, 1191 (1997)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1070/RM1997v052n06ABEH002155/meta). Although it is the ultimate goal to reach this threshold in an experiment that is scalable to larger sizes, the overhead that is needed to implement a fully fault-tolerant gate set with current codes [A. G. Fowler, et. al., Physical Review A 86, 032324 (2012)](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.86.032324) seems prohibitively large [N. C. Jones, et. al., Physical Review X 2,\n",
    "031007 (2012)](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.2.031007). In turn, it is expected that in the near term the progress in quantum experiments will lead to devices with dynamics, which are beyond what can be simulated with a conventional computer. This leads to the question: what computational tasks could be accomplished with only limited, or no error correction? \n",
    "\n",
    "The suggestions of near-term applications in such quantum devices mostly center around quantum simulations with short-depth circuit [D. Wecker, et. al., Physical Review A\n",

Furthermore, certain problems in material simulation may be tackled by hybrid quantum-classical algorithms [Bela Bauer,et. al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03859). In most such applications, the task can be abstracted to applying a short-depth quantum circuits to some simple initial state and then estimating the expectation value of some observable after the circuit has been applied. This estimation must be accurate enough to achieve a simulation precision comparable or exceeding that of classical algorithms. Yet, although the quantum system evolves coherently for the most part of the short-depth circuit, the effects of decoherence already become apparent as an error in the estimate of the observable. For the simulation to be of value, the effect of this error needs to be mitigated.\n",

    " In the NISQ era when the error correcting protocols are not feasible the role of error mitigating techniques rises. DD is one of such techniques from the error mitigation arsenal. It's a well-studied method which is designed to suppress the effects of decoherence via active intervention to the system evolution. Namely, by applying certain  control sequences on the system one can cancel the system-environment interaction to a given order. \n",
